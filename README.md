# Forest-Fire-Prediction
This project involves the development and deployment of a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of forest fires. The model is built using logistic regression for binary classification, with data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model development executed in Python.

Key Features
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducted EDA to gain insights into the dataset, assess data quality, and identify key features for the model.
Model Implementation: Utilized logistic regression with scikit-learn for the binary classification of forest fire probability.
Data Processing: Leveraged Pandas and NumPy for efficient data manipulation and preprocessing tasks.
Deployment: Deployed the model using Pickle for integration into real-time applications.

Tools and Libraries
Jupyter Notebook: For development and experimentation.
Python Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, and scikit-learn for data handling and machine learning tasks.

This repository contains the codebase and necessary files for data processing, EDA, model training, and deployment steps.
